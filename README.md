# Future PuMP Projects

| Project Title | Number of Developers Needed | Description |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| Resources infinite scrolling | n/a | Frontend project: add infinite scrolling for the blogs & the job resources stuff (where there would be N initial results and once they scroll to the bottom, more results would pop up). Useful to avoid pages that go 2km down.
Sharon recommendation: i think react hooks would be better hear just noting it down - redux is becoming more outdated but context is still feasible |
